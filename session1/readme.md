# Omnipresent JavaScript

JavaScript is always passing the variables by value. However, because the non-primitive types (Objects, functions and arrays) hold in its values the address (reference) to the allocated object, this reference is actually passed and the callee, hence, is able to change the balue of the passed reference.
