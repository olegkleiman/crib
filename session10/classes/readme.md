# JS Classes

JS classes are designed to mimic the OO constructs whenever is possible. This includes encapsulation, inheritance and polymorpism.

## 1. Encapsulation
``` JS
class Point {
  #x
  #y
  constructor(x, y) {
    this.#x = x;
    this.#y = y;
  }
}
```

## 2. Inheritance

## 3. Polymorphism
