# Kotlin for Mobile

In previous sections, we saw how Kotlin code may be transpiled into self-contained (fat) jar to run under JVM or into JS to run under the browser. Actually, these two transpilers are part of the wide family. There is a transpiler from Kotlin to Swift: kotlinc-native. The whole family made possible due to the exceptional language design on which Kotlin is based. Because Kotlin is also easily transpiled into Java, there are no needs to the additional effort in order to run Kotlin code for Android. Both Java and Android are intercommunicating smoothly within the Android application.
