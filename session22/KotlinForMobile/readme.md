# Kotlin for Mobile

In previous sections we saw how Kotlin code may be transpiled into self-contained (fat) jar to run under JVM or into JS to run under browser.
Actually these two transpilers are the part of the wide family. There is a transpiler from Kotlin to Switft: <code>kotlinc-native</code>. The whole family made possibly due to the exceptional language design on which Kotlin is based. 
Because Kotlin are also easely transpiled into Java, there is no needs to additional effort in order to run Kotlin code for Android. Both Java and Android are intercommunicates smoothly within Android application.
